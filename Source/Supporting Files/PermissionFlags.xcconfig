// This hook allows users of the framework to provide build flags without modifying any files within the Permission repository. See README.md for instructions.
#include? "../../PermissionConfiguration.xcconfig"

// This secondary hook allows to provide a configuration two levels further up the directory hierarchy. It exists primarily for Carthage support to allow for config files outside of auto-generated directories that may not be under version control.
// Carthage directories are typically structured:
//    "Carthage/Build/iOS/Permission"
#include? "../../../../../PermissionConfiguration.xcconfig"
